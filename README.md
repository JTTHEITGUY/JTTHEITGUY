<h2>üë®‚ÄçüíªComputer Hardware Project: Custom-Designed PC Solutions: Personalized Builds for Users:</h2>


**Project Overview**

This project is a culmination of a passion-driven venture that I've pursued over the last few years. It has been a fulfilling journey, aiding not only in my personal learning and skill enhancement but also in assisting those who are less technically inclined.

**Role and Responsibilities**

In the role I undertook for this project, my primary focus was on constructing custom computers that are precisely aligned with the unique needs and preferences of each client. This involved a comprehensive process where I:

- **Consulted with Clients**: Understood specific requirements and preferences to deliver tailor-made solutions.
- **Hardware Selection**: Recommended and selected optimal hardware components including GPUs, CPUs, RAM, power supplies, hard drives, and motherboards.
- **Case Selection**: Chose appropriate computer cases that align with the functionality and aesthetics required by the client.
- **System Assembly**: Skillfully assembled the components to build functional and efficient computer systems.
- **Software Management**: Installed operating systems, managed software installations, and updates ensuring smooth operation.
- **Troubleshooting**: Addressed and resolved both hardware and software issues, providing a reliable post-build support for clients.

This project has not only been a testament to my technical acumen but also a reflection of my commitment to client satisfaction and service excellence.

</p>
<p>

  **Step 1:** Install Azure CLI
Ensure that the Azure CLI is installed on your Windows PC. If not, you can download and install it from the Official Azure CLI Page - (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?tabs=azure-cli)


</p>

</p>
<p>

  **Step 2:** Open Windows Powershell 
on your Windows PC. You can do this by searching for Windows Powershell in the Windows search bar.

</p>
<p>

**Step 3:**   Login to Azure
To log in to your Azure account via the Azure CLI, run the following command:
**az login**


</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>

**Step 4:** Set the Subscription (Optional)
If you have multiple Azure subscriptions and want to specify which one to use, run:
az account set --subscription "<Your-Subscription-Id>"
Replace <Your-Subscription-Id> with your actual Azure subscription ID.



</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>

Step 5: Create the Resource Group
To create a new resource group, use the following command: **az group create --name <ResourceGroupName> --location <Location>**.
Replace "ResourceGroupName" with the name you want for your resource group and <Location> with the Azure region (e.g., eastus, westus).


</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>

Step 6: Verify the Creation
To confirm that your resource group has been created, you can list all your resource groups with  following command:
**az group list --output table**
This will display a table of all your resource groups along with their details.
